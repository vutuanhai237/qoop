**Description**: The quantum object optimizer ($\langle {\rm qo|op}\rangle)$ is a Python library that offers a framework for optimizing quantum circuits to represent quantum objects such as quantum states and Hamiltonians. This optimizer is a quantum compilation process in which an ansatz is trained to compile the information from a given quantum object. The software generates shallow circuits that can be implemented on various quantum computers and reduces the time required to process data and simulation. It also allows users to customize the algorithm for practical and proactive solutions to quantum circuit design. In this way, $\langle {\rm qo|op}\rangle$ has the potential to impact both scientific research and practical applications in quantum technology significantly.
